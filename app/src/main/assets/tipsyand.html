    <h3 class="" contenteditable="false"> First way to go</h3>
    <p>Find and kill Meisa ito. She has blue hair.Follow her into class on the first floor.Sit at a dest by the window and take a short test. Eventually she will leave class and head to the girls' bathroom.<br> Kill her in there and and bring her down to the garden and bury her. when you do so,Akari will commment that she talk to Makio. follow the gray heart icon to him and talk to him<br>GoodLuck</p>

<section> <h3>walk around armed</h3>
    <p>When you think about it is kind of amazing how a japanese high school student can carry a knife, scissors , a box cutter, a screw driver and a katana in her uniform without arising suspicion.Cause that's what happens in Yandere Simulator.That unifrom has a lot a of hiding spots!</p></section>
<section> <h3>NightMare</h3>
    <p>Find Meisa and kill her. she is wih Makio outside the school. You don't need to worry about burying her or being caught since the stage ends immediately afterwards.</p></section>

<section> <h3>Make giant naked titns appear</h3>
    <p>This was the most surprising feature to me,since I Activated it y accident the first time i was playing the game. If you press The "T" Button at avy time the most random thing will happen: half a dozen of naked titns will start a parade around the high schoool as epic Japenese music starts playing.You can talk to them or even kill them with you katana</p></section>

<section> <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
    <p>Completing a day or nightmare awards coins. when you are in Akari's apartment you can interact with her mirror to purchase and select new clothing ans hairstyles with coins. This is entirely cosmetic and has no effect on gameplay.</p>
